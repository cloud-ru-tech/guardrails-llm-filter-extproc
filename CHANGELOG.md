# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Optional keyword pre-filter for the sensitive scanner
  (`GUARDRAILS_KEYWORD_PREFILTER_ENABLED`, off by default): skips a rule's regex
  when none of its `keywords` is present in the text. It is recall-preserving —
  applied only to rules whose regex provably requires a keyword in every match
  (verified at compile time via a `regexp/syntax` analysis), so detections never
  change; rules that are not eligible are always scanned and listed in a startup
  log. Benchmarks (`tests/benchmarks/keyword_prefilter`) show a ~2–3× scan
  speedup on representative request bodies.
- Anthropic `/v1/messages`: the top-level `system` prompt is now masked (it was
  previously left untouched), closing a path where PII/secrets in `system`
  reached the model unmasked.
- Custom-rule limits: `GUARDRAILS_RULES_MAX_CUSTOM` (default 500) and
  `GUARDRAILS_RULES_MAX_PATTERN_LEN` (default 4096) bound how many custom rules
  and how large a regex the configuration API accepts, protecting the request
  hot path. Exceeding them returns 409 / 400 respectively; `0` disables a limit.
- Metric `unknown_format_passthrough_total`: counts response bodies passed
  through unchanged because their API format was unknown (fail-open).
- Metric `unguarded_path_passthrough_total`: counts requests passed through
  unmasked because their path matched no guarded LLM path. The closed-source
  origin rejected such requests with HTTP 400; the OSS verdict model
  (mask/pass — never block) forwards them instead, and this counter is the
  operator's signal that the ext_proc filter is attached more broadly than
  `GUARDRAILS_PATHS` covers.

### Changed

- Reference Envoy config (`examples/quickstart/proxy-config.yaml`) now pins
  `generate_request_id: true` / `preserve_external_request_id: false` and the
  docs document the `x-request-id` and override-header trust boundaries — the
  edge proxy must own `x-request-id` and strip `x-guardrails-data-types`.
- SSE demask hot path: the placeholder scanner now resolves compiled rules once
  per stream and scans small fragments sequentially instead of spawning a
  goroutine fan-out per token-sized chunk.
- An unknown/empty API format on a streaming response now passes the stream
  through unchanged (with `unknown_format_passthrough_total`), matching the
  full-body policy, instead of routing it into the chat-completions processor
  where named-event streams would leak placeholders undemasked.

### Fixed

- Anthropic `/v1/messages` requests: `tool_use.input` is now masked per decoded
  string leaf. Previously the raw JSON object text was regex-scanned: PII
  containing quotes/backslashes/escapes could be missed entirely, and when a
  match broke the object's JSON validity the original was sent to the model
  unmasked while metrics, masking state and the audit record claimed it was
  masked. Metrics/state/audit are now recorded only after the body is patched.
- Non-streamed `/v1/messages` responses are no longer round-tripped through the
  Anthropic SDK's typed `Message` (which fabricated `stop_details`/`container`
  objects and union zero values, coerced `stop_sequence: null` to `""`, and
  dropped unmodeled fields on every masked response); demasking now extracts
  and patches fields in place like the other two formats. The
  `anthropic-sdk-go` dependency is gone.
- Anthropic SSE: restored originals inserted into `input_json_delta` fragments
  are now JSON-escaped, so an original containing a quote or backslash no
  longer corrupts the tool input the client accumulates (stream and non-stream
  tool-input demasking now agree).
- chat/completions SSE: non-demaskable frames (refusal/audio/annotations/
  role-only/empty keepalive deltas) no longer force-flush the choice demaskers —
  a placeholder split across such a frame was emitted as raw fragments and
  never restored.
- chat/completions SSE: a tool call whose arguments never arrive (parameterless
  calls as streamed by some OpenAI-compatible backends) is no longer dropped;
  its id/name announcement frame is forwarded.
- chat/completions SSE: providers attaching `usage` to every content chunk
  (vLLM continuous usage stats) no longer grow the metadata buffer for the
  whole stream and dump stale usage snapshots at stream end; usage frames are
  now emitted in their stream position, preserving the per-chunk cadence the
  client requested.
- Responses SSE: `sequence_number` is now strictly monotonic across synthetic
  flush frames — the synthetic claims the next number and subsequent real
  frames are renumbered past it (previously the client saw duplicates and
  out-of-order numbers right at the flush point).
- Non-streamed chat/completions responses no longer lose unmodeled fields
  (`system_fingerprint`, `service_tier`, `logprobs`, `refusal`, annotations) or
  gain a spurious empty `usage` object when a response is demasked; demasking
  now patches fields in place instead of round-tripping a partial struct.
- Anthropic SSE: a held text tail is no longer dropped when a `text_delta`
  arrives without a preceding `content_block_start` (or on a delta/block type
  desync) — flushing now keys off the live demaskers, not the recorded block
  type.
- chat/completions SSE: frames carrying only `refusal`, `audio` or a role-only
  opening delta are forwarded instead of being silently dropped.
- Responses SSE tool-call `arguments` now use the same structural demask as the
  full-body path, so a restored secret containing a quote/backslash stays valid
  JSON instead of leaking a placeholder.
- Responses SSE synthetic delta frames now include `item_id` and
  `sequence_number`, which strict SDKs require.
- Unknown/empty response format now passes the body through unchanged instead of
  rewriting it into an empty chat-completions skeleton.
- chat/completions SSE frames are serialized without HTML-escaping `<`, `>`,
  `&`, matching the other dialects and preserving placeholder markers.

### Removed

- Legacy `/v1/completions` (OpenAI text completions) is no longer supported;
  use `/v1/chat/completions`. Prompt masking and `choices[].text` demasking for
  that endpoint were dropped in the OSS refactor and are not being restored.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-06

Initial public release. An Envoy ext_proc v3 gRPC service that masks
PII/secrets in LLM request bodies and demasks them in responses (including SSE
streams). Verdict model is mask/pass only; the data path is fail-open.

### Added

- ext_proc data path: request-body masking and response demasking for OpenAI
  (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`) and Anthropic
  (`/v1/messages`) formats, including token-by-token SSE demasking.
- Configurable request paths via `GUARDRAILS_PATHS`.
- Regex + validator rule engine (~260 built-in rules) with an immutable,
  atomically reloadable registry.
- Detect/shadow mode (`GUARDRAILS_MODE=detect`): scan and record metrics/audit
  without mutating traffic.
- Pluggable persistence (`in_memory` / `redis` / `postgres`) for masking state,
  custom rules, settings, and the audit trail, with a shared conformance suite.
- Optional at-rest encryption of masking state (AES-256-GCM,
  `GUARDRAILS_STORE_ENCRYPTION_*`).
- HTTP configuration API (rules CRUD, per-rule enable/disable via
  `PATCH /v1/rules/{id}`, global settings, audit query) with optional bearer
  auth and an OpenAPI spec.
- Global settings with a narrow-only per-request override header.
- Optional audit trail with a non-blocking, fail-open recorder.
- Prometheus metrics + alert rules and a Grafana dashboard.
- Packaging: distroless Docker image, Kubernetes manifests, and an
  `examples/quickstart` end-to-end demo (Envoy + mock LLM).
